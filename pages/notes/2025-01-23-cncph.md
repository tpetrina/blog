## **PostgresSQL in Kubernetes: Operation - Day 2**

Operators:
- CloudNativePG - https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.16/
- EDB CloudNativePG - same as before, but has advanced features like compat, backup

Automated failover
Storage
- Use PVC - automated generation; but can use templates to use storage classes
- not Statefulsets

Ensure that instances are not running on the same node

Restoring entire cluster by recreating it from backup and deleting old one
cnpg plugin for kubectl - https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.20/kubectl-plugin/
Connection pooling with PgBouncer

Backups:
- on demand or on schedule

Q: As platform engineer, how do I offer this to devs?

From https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.16/database_import/:
CloudNativePG provides two main ways to import objects from the source cluster into the destination cluster:

- **microservice approach**: the destination cluster is designed to host a single application database owned by the specified application user, as recommended by the CloudNativePG project
    
- **monolith approach**: the destination cluster is designed to host multiple databases and different users, imported from the source cluster

Q: How to add extensions like timescale?
Some are supported, but you can:
1. create customized image
2. ???

Q: CDC? E.g. Debezium
Yes?
