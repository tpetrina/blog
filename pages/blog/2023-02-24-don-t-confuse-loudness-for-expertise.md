Discussing a technical topic often times feels more precice than discussing
sports, religion or politics. It's not an opinion, it's an argument! And usually
the argument is backed by an experience or an expertise (which is nothing but
distilled experience).

However, our basic instinct is still to weigh someone's opinions as valid
arguments if they are delivered with a certain loudness or certainty. Why else
would the person be so sure or certain if they don't know what they are talking
about?

And this is the trap of loudness: people delivering them are assumed to be
experts - even more so by non-technical people.

Is there a way to fix it?
Ideally - argumentation with a strong focus on precision _might_ lead to
removing ambiguities and might force someone to go deeper into the topic, thus
exposing their lack of expertise.

However, I've seen this backfire. Usually when the loud person has the aura of
position or when they are in a priviledge position e.g. working closely with non
technical person, longer tenure or merely has a larger role in a project. Then
the loudness naturally wins are left with a bitter taste.

What's the conclusion? Picking battles carefully and avoiding argumentation when
a clear resolution can be reached or when it cannot be reached even with a
successful argumentation from your side.
